     * There are 3 types of reduce method, which differ by their signatures and returning types:
     * 1. identity - the initial value for an accumulator, or a default value if a stream is empty and there is
     * nothing to accumulate
     * 2. accumulator - a function which specifies the logic of the aggregation of elements.
     * As the accumulator creates a new value for every step of reducing, the quantity of new values
     * equals the streamâ€™s size and only the last value is useful. This is not very good for the performance.
     * 3. combiner - a function which aggregates the results of the accumulator. We only call combiner in a parallel
     * mode to reduce the results of accumulators from different threads.
